I am also a graduate student of [University of Tsukuba](https://www.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/english/index.html) and am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of [Prof. Kazuhiro Fukui](http://www.cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~kfukui/english/indexE.html).

I previously studied digital circuit design at the [Ikeda Lab](http://www.mos.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) of [the University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), where I received BE and ME degrees under the supervision of [Prof. Makoto Ikeda](http://www.mos.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~ikeda/).
